## String Calculator Kata

This project implements the String Calculator kata using JavaScript and Jest,
strictly following Test Driven Development (TDD).

## How to Run

npm install
npm test

## TDD Approach

Each requirement was introduced by writing a failing test first.
Only the minimum code required to pass the test was added.
Refactoring was done only after tests passed.

Features such as custom delimiters, negative number validation,
and multiple delimiters were implemented incrementally in separate commits.

## Evidence of TDD

The commit history shows small, focused commits where each new behavior
was added after introducing a failing test.
